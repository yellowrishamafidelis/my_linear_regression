# Welcome to My Linear Regression

***

## Task
This project involves implementing a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between two variables. The challenge is to compute the best-fit line by optimizing the model parameters using both closed-form solutions and gradient descent.

## Description
The solution involves creating a Python program that uses the normal equation for closed-form optimization and a gradient descent algorithm for iterative optimization. It calculates the best-fit line for a set of data points and visualizes the result.

## Installation
No installation required beyond standard Python libraries and `numpy`:
```
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
To use the linear regression model, you can run the script and follow the prompts or modify the code to input your own data:
```
python my_linear_regression.py
```
